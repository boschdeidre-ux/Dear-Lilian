        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="images/Deidre.jpg" alt="Deidrè Bosch, founder of Dear Lilian" class="founder-photo">
        <p>
          My journey into natural living began with my husband's celiac diagnosis, which spurred me to find healthier alternatives. 
          After leaving my 23-year career in education to dedicate more time to my daughter, I delved into crafting natural beauty 
          and cleaning products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with tallow soap (boerseep) for laundry, I was amazed by its effectiveness. This led me to experiment with 
          bath soaps, facial creams, serums, body butters, and hand creams. It's been an incredible and ongoing adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Deidrè Bosch, a mother and wife grateful for my loving family. Based in Johannesburg, I craft each bar 
          by hand using time-honored cold-process methods that preserve the natural goodness of our ingredients.

        <h2>About our products</h2>
        <p>
          At Dear Lilian, each bar is carefully crafted in small batches to ensure the highest quality 
          and attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          With tallow as the main ingredient—a time-honored, nutrient-rich base that's remarkably 
          similar to human skin. We combine this with nourishing oils like olive, coconut, and shea butter, along 
          with pure essential oils for natural fragrance. Every ingredient is chosen for its skin-loving properties 
          and natural benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our soap is a gentle, moisturizing bar that cleanses without stripping your skin's 
          natural oils. Each soap is cured for 4-6 weeks to create a long-lasting, luxurious bar that's perfect for 
          all skin types.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in transparency and simplicity—no harsh chemicals, no synthetic fragrances, and no unnecessary 
          additives. Just pure, wholesome ingredients that are good for your skin and kind to the environment.
        </p>

            Every batch is made with care and attention to detail. Our cold-process method takes longer, but it 
            produces a superior soap that's gentle on skin and full of natural glycerin.
