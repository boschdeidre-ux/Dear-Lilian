        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="images/Deidre.jpg" alt="Deidrè Bosch, founder of Dear Lilian" class="founder-photo">
        <p>
          My journey into natural living began with my husband's celiac diagnosis, which spurred me to find healthier alternatives. 
          After leaving my 23-year career in education to dedicate more time to my daughter, I delved into crafting natural beauty 
          and cleaning products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with tallow soap (boerseep) for laundry, I was amazed by its effectiveness. This led me to experiment with 
          bath soaps, facial creams, serums, body butters, and hand creams. It's been an incredible and ongoing adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Deidrè Bosch, a mother and wife grateful for my loving family. Based in Johannesburg, I craft each bar 
          by hand using time-honored cold-process methods that preserve the natural goodness of our ingredients.

            We use only natural, skin-loving ingredients with tallow as our main and most natural ingredient, along with olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and pure essential oils. 
            No synthetic fragrances, harsh chemicals, or unnecessary additives.

            From our recycled paper packaging to our commitment to minimal waste, we're dedicated to reducing our

            Every batch is made with care and attention to detail. Our cold-process method takes longer, but it 
            produces a superior soap that's gentle on skin and full of natural glycerin.
