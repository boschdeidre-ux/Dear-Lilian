          <h2>Tallow</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Our main and most natural ingredient.</strong> Tallow from grass-fed animals is rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K, 
            which are essential for healthy skin. Its fatty acid composition is remarkably similar to human skin cells, making it 
            highly compatible and easily absorbed. Tallow is deeply moisturizing, helps repair the skin barrier, and has been used 
            for centuries in traditional skincare. It creates a creamy, long-lasting bar that's gentle yet effective for all skin types.

          <h2>Olive Oil</h2>
          <p>
            Known for its moisturizing and antioxidant properties, olive oil is rich in vitamins E and A. It helps maintain skin 
            elasticity and softness while providing a gentle cleansing action. Olive oil creates a mild, conditioning lather that 
            doesn't strip the skin of its natural oils, making it ideal for sensitive skin.

        <article class="value-item">
          <h2>Coconut Oil</h2>
          <p>
            Coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and antimicrobial, helping to cleanse and protect the skin. It produces a rich, 
            fluffy lather and provides excellent cleansing properties. High in lauric acid, coconut oil is deeply nourishing and 
            helps create a hard, long-lasting bar of soap.

        <article class="value-item">
          <h2>Shea Butter</h2>
          <p>
            Extracted from the nuts of the African shea tree, shea butter is incredibly moisturizing and packed with vitamins and 
            fatty acids. It's known for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to soothe dry, irritated skin. Shea butter 
            adds a luxurious, creamy texture to our soaps and helps maintain skin's natural moisture balance.
          </p>

        <article class="value-item">
          <h2>Essential Oils</h2>
          <p>
            We use only pure essential oils for fragrance—no synthetic scents. Essential oils provide natural aromatherapy benefits 
            while offering various skin benefits. For example, lavender is calming and helps soothe irritation, while tea tree has 
            natural antibacterial properties. Each essential oil is carefully selected to complement the soap's purpose and provide 
            a gentle, natural fragrance.

        <h2>Cold-Process Method</h2>
        <p>
          Our cold-process method preserves the natural benefits of these ingredients. Unlike mass-produced soaps that use high heat 
          (which can degrade nutrients), cold processing maintains the integrity of vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds. 
          This traditional method also produces natural glycerin, a humectant that attracts moisture to the skin—something that's 
          often removed in commercial soap production.
        </p>

      <div class="cta-box">
        <h2>Experience the Difference</h2>
        <p>
          Natural ingredients make a real difference. No harsh chemicals, no synthetic fragrances—just pure, skin-loving goodness 
          in every bar.
