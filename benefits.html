          <h2>Tallow</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Our main and most natural ingredient.</strong> Tallow from grass-fed animals is remarkably beneficial for your skin. 
            Here's why beef tallow is so good for your skin:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li id="biocompatible"><strong>Biocompatible with Human Skin:</strong> Tallow's fatty acid composition is nearly identical to the natural oils (sebum) in human skin, making it highly compatible and easily absorbed without clogging pores.</li>
            <li id="vitamins"><strong>Rich in Fat-Soluble Vitamins:</strong> Contains high levels of vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are essential for skin health, cell regeneration, and maintaining a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li id="moisturizing"><strong>Deeply Moisturizing:</strong> Provides long-lasting hydration that penetrates deep into the skin layers, helping to combat dryness and maintain softness.</li>
            <li id="barrier"><strong>Repairs Skin Barrier:</strong> Helps restore and strengthen the skin's natural protective barrier, which is crucial for keeping moisture in and irritants out.</li>
            <li id="anti-inflammatory"><strong>Anti-Inflammatory Properties:</strong> Contains conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and other compounds that help reduce inflammation, redness, and skin irritation.</li>
            <li id="anti-aging"><strong>Anti-Aging Benefits:</strong> The rich vitamin content helps minimize the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots while promoting skin elasticity.</li>
            <li id="healing"><strong>Supports Skin Healing:</strong> Promotes faster healing of minor wounds, burns, and skin conditions due to its nourishing and restorative properties.</li>
            <li id="non-comedogenic"><strong>Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Despite being an oil, tallow doesn't clog pores and is suitable for all skin types, including acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li id="balances"><strong>Balances Skin's Natural Oils:</strong> Helps regulate sebum production, making it beneficial for both dry and oily skin types.</li>
            <li id="traditional"><strong>Time-Tested Traditional Remedy:</strong> Has been used for centuries in traditional skincare across cultures, proving its effectiveness and safety.</li>
            <li id="soap"><strong>Creates Superior Soap:</strong> Produces a creamy, long-lasting bar with a luxurious lather that cleanses gently without stripping the skin of its natural oils.</li>

          </ul>

        <article class="value-item" id="coconut-oil">
          <h2>Coconut Oil</h2>
          <p>
            Coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and antimicrobial, helping to cleanse and protect the skin. It produces a rich, 
            fluffy lather and provides excellent cleansing properties. High in lauric acid, coconut oil is deeply nourishing and 
            helps create a hard, long-lasting bar of soap.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="value-item" id="castor-oil">
          <h2>Castor Oil</h2>
          <p>
            Castor oil is known for its exceptional moisturizing and healing properties. Rich in ricinoleic acid, it helps to 
            hydrate and soften the skin while providing anti-inflammatory benefits. In soap making, castor oil creates a stable, 
            luxurious lather and helps the soap retain moisture, making it particularly beneficial for dry or sensitive skin.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="value-item" id="olive-oil">
          <h2>Olive Oil</h2>
          <p>
            Known for its moisturizing and antioxidant properties, olive oil is rich in vitamins E and A. It helps maintain skin 
            elasticity and softness while providing a gentle cleansing action. Olive oil creates a mild, conditioning lather that 
            doesn't strip the skin of its natural oils, making it ideal for sensitive skin.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="value-item">
          <h2>Shea Butter</h2>
          <p>
            Extracted from the nuts of the African shea tree, shea butter is incredibly moisturizing and packed with vitamins and 
            fatty acids. It's known for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to soothe dry, irritated skin. Shea butter 
            adds a luxurious, creamy texture to our soaps and helps maintain skin's natural moisture balance.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="value-item">
          <h2>Essential Oils</h2>
          <p>
            We use only pure essential oils for fragrance—no synthetic scents. Essential oils provide natural aromatherapy benefits 
            while offering various skin benefits. For example, lavender is calming and helps soothe irritation, while tea tree has 
            natural antibacterial properties. Each essential oil is carefully selected to complement the soap's purpose and provide 
            a gentle, natural fragrance.
          </p>

      <div class="story-box">
        <h2>Cold-Process Method</h2>
        <p>
          Our cold-process method preserves the natural benefits of these ingredients. Unlike mass-produced soaps that use high heat 
          (which can degrade nutrients), cold processing maintains the integrity of vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds. 
          This traditional method also produces natural glycerin, a humectant that attracts moisture to the skin—something that's 
          often removed in commercial soap production.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="cta-box">
        <h2>Experience the Difference</h2>
        <p>
          Natural ingredients make a real difference. No harsh chemicals, no synthetic fragrances—just pure, skin-loving goodness 
          in every bar.
